# Haskell-Cipher
Just making the code public. 
First coding project I've done independent of school work. 
The goal being to Learn Haskell and programming fundamentals while figuring out this concrete task. 
The maps all had to be invertible, which lended itself nicely to Haskell and some mathematical ideas.
